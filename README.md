* automata university assignments made together with my teammate Andreea Matei
* B,D are about creating the basics of a custom programming language
* NFA is about generating graphViz input from z3 output in order to make a digraph
* Sudoku is a bonus one created by me which takes z3output and converts it into graphViz input to be able to show sudoku in a graph form
